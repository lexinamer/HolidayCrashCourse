### All About Type
Fonts are vital to a projectâ€™s success or failure. Thoughtfully choosing the right font allows you to evoke a particular emotion or fit a certain style. Typography is not just about legibility. It is a blending of art and science and can serve a functional purpose. 

#### Good font resources: 
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Fontspace](http://www.fontspace.com/)
- [Dafont](http://www.dafont.com/)
- [What the Font](https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/)
- [Font Pair](http://fontpair.co/)

#### Main Font Categories

## All About Colors
The use of color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions. It is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and cause physiological reactions, which becomes especially important in design.

 The best practice is to start off with shades of grey and then slowly add 1 or 2 accent colors until you feel good with colors. Inverted colors are really easy to work with- for example, white text on red background and red text on white background.  
 
[Kuler](https://color.adobe.com/) by Adobe is a great resource for exploring and learning about colors. It lets you create color palettes.
